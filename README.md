<h1>hjem <em>&mdash; a self-hosted API for your home</em></h1>

> Note: "hjem" is a work in progress

## Summary
"hjem" acts as a switchboard for all your smart home devices such as the Nest Thermostat, Philips Hue, Sonos Speakers or your Alarm.com alarm system. The individual products are abstracted away and simple concepts like "temperature", "light", or "alarm" are used instead. This allows you to plug and play any components you'd like.

## Features
The app has two main purposes:
* A central hub for all your "smart home" data, with a customizable dashboard to visualize things such as temperature, motion sensors, etc.
* A trigger and timing system that allows you to do things such as turn on the light in the morning or make sure that your speakers are turned off when you arm your alarm system to leave the house.
