<h1>hjem <em>&mdash; a self-hosted API for your home</em></h1>

> Note: "hjem" is a work in progress

## Summary
"hjem" acts as a switchboard for all your smart home devices such as the Nest Thermostat, Philips Hue, Sonos Speakers or your Alarm.com alarm system. The individual products are abstracted away and simple concepts like "temperature", "light", or "alarm" are used instead. This allows you to plug and play any components you'd like.

## Features
The app has three main purposes:
* **A central API to interact with and access all your devices:** Build your own custom apps, with one central API to control and consume data from your smart devices.
* **Collect & visualize data:** Monitor your electricy usage, temperature, etc.
* **Triggers and timers:** Flash lightbulbs when the washer is ready, fire up some music on your Sonos Speakers to wake you up in the morning, etc.
